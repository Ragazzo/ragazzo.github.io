Last years i was spending developing complex software with various approaches: 
Domain Driven Design, Service Oriented Architecture, Event Driven Architecture,
Command Query Segregation Responsibility (CQRS), etc.
In this blog i will share my thoughts and knowledge about these approaches and
other things that may be helpful to understand them.
